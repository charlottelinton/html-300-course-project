HTML 300 WEBSITE PROPOSAL

For my course project this quarter I propose to create a website focused on
sustainable sewing. The target audience will primarily be sewists and crafters,
as well as those interested in sustainability in general. The site will feature
articles about the subject, a gallery of projects, and a store of products. I
want to build this site for the following reasons:
•	It is a topic about which I am relatively knowledgeable, so I will easily be
able to generate content.
•	I can integrate different ways to display that content in order to demonstrate
different programming skills e.g. a project gallery, a blog page.
•	I can integrate an ecommerce aspect to the site by creating a store page.
I would like to use the Google Custom Search API to make content and images
on my site easily searchable for the user.
